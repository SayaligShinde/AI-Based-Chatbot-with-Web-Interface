# 🤖 AI-Based Chatbot with Web Interface

This is a mini-project that demonstrates how to build an AI-based chatbot using Python, PHP, and a simple web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The chatbot can respond to basic inputs and is accessible via browser — even remotely using tools like Ngrok.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Start XAMPP
- Run Apache module from the XAMPP Control Panel

### 2. Place Project Folder
Copy this folder into:
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\
```

### 3. Visit the Chatbot
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost/AI-Based%20Chatbot%20with%20Web%20Interface/index.html
```

### 4. Test It!
Type messages like:
- `hello`
- `how are you`
- `tell me a joke`
- `what time is it`
- `bye`

## 🌍 Access Publicly with Ngrok (optional)

1. Install Ngrok → [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. In command prompt:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 80
   ```
3. Visit the public link like:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok.io/AI-Based%20Chatbot%20with%20Web%20Interface/index.html
   ```

✅ Now you can access the chatbot from **any device** on any network!

## 🧠 Future Improvements (Optional)

- Use NLP libraries (like `nltk`, `transformers`)
- Add chat history storage (database or file)
- Include voice input/output
- Deploy to a public PHP hosting platform
